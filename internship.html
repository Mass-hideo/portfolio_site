            <p>This summer, I had the privilege of working at Mediaocean for two months, as an intern in
                the User Experience department. While there, I had the opportunity to work on a variety of
                projects.
                The first one, that lasted across the entire internship, involved comparing components from Mediaocean's
                design system across their platforms, and finding potential use cases for designs from other companies.
            </p>
            </br>
            <p>The second project involved updating a component design in figma that had never been implemented, and
                then creating documentation for said component. </p>
            </br>
            <p>The final project was the most intensive. It's crux of it was collaborating with my department manager
                in designing a contact list. It involved
                meeting with the clients who had made the request, creating a preliminary design, taking feedback from
                my manager, and then working to create a refined design that could potentially be eventually implemented
                in Mediaocean's Prisma Omni platform.
            </p>
            </br>
            <p>Below, you'll find some samples I was able to take with me from this experience.</p>
